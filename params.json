It was not much of an issue during my early childhood, but it became an ongoing personal issue that I dealt with from during my teenage years.\r\n\r\n I come from a family that would generally be considered unorthodox by current standards. My parents were an interracial couple who met in Iowa during college.  They married in their twenties, and eventually decided to settle down in Iowa, and adopt three kids.  I was fortunate enough to be the first of those three adopted, and we all enjoyed a stable childhood that is usually not afforded to kids who go through the foster system.  \r\n\r\nInitially fact that I was adopted did not make a big impact on me;  I never had the feeling that my family was not my “real” family or that I was in some way different.  My brother and sister were my support system, we grew up at a close age and our bond was strong.  However, as I came into my formative teenage years, I initially struggled with the idea of being different than most of my peers in regards to family.\r\n\r\nAn in class assignment in our 8th grade personal development class was to draw features of ourselvs that we saw in our parents and siblings.  I remember my classmates began diligently working on their drawings marking their various features, and then looking at my blank paper, blacking out, and looking at that same blank paper soaked in tears.  It was the first time that I remember my adoption really effecting me.\r\n\r\nDuring my formative years in high school I struggled as I began to form my personal identity, and in many ways this was linked to my inability to reconcile the idea of my “real” family.  My skin was darker than my moms, but lighter than my dad’s; I had facial features of a black person, but I looked like neither of them. Classmates would frequently ask me why I did not look like my siblings, and my answer of, “because we're adopted” was often replied with, “where's your real family?”  I internalized that reply as an invalidation of my family and I struggled with that idea for years, and it was not until my twenties that I began to reconcile.\r\n\r\nWhen I was off on my own and in college the idea of family was truly cemented into my physique. When I found myself stressed from school or lonely on campus it was my parents who I called, and it was to my family’s house where I went when I was on break from school.  My younger siblings are my best friends, and part of the joy going back was that I knew I was going to see them when I went home.\r\n\r\n I struggled again when my parents divorced during my sophomore year in college, but it was my brothers and sister who helped keep my head above the sand.  I was able to fight through and graduate, and I attest a lot of that to the strength of our bond.  Our family is still healing to this day, but I can feel that healing process in itself making our overall bond stronger.\r\n\r\nI have stopped thinking about trying to search for my birth parents; I have recently come upon the means to find them, but other than knowing about my medical history, the urge that I have felt for years to find them as it relates to my identity is no longer there.  I am happy with the person I have become and at this point in my late twenties I know who my family is, and other than forming my own, I have no need find another.\r\n\r\nIn a little over two months my little sister will be have her first child.  I am looking forward to the experience of being an Uncle with everything it entails.  In relation to family, It is the current thing that occupies my mind.  I get the saying “Ohana” from Ian, the baby of our family and the only biological kid of my parents.  His seventeenth birthday is today, September nineteenth, the day I'm writing this. He frequently uses the saying, from Lilo and Stitch, as a hastag on social media pictures with his football and basketball teammates.  I can tell by his use of the word that he truly understands that the idea of family is not restricted to blood. I dedicate this to him, because Ohana!  \r\n\r\n-peace\r\n\r\n\r\n",
